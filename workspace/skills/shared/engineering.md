# Engineering Principles

- Make it work, make it right, make it fast — in that order
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness
- Design for failure: everything will break
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Observability is not optional
- Security is everyone's responsibility
- Document decisions, not just code
