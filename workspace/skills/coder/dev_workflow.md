# Development Workflow

## Flow

1. Receive task with acceptance criteria from Boss
2. Create feature branch: `feat/<short-name>`
3. Write implementation plan (bullet points, not essay)
4. Implement with tests
5. Self-review: lint, test, security check
6. Create PR with summary
7. Address review feedback
8. Merge and deploy

## Before Starting

- Read the full spec / decision memo
- Identify unknowns → escalate to Boss or Researcher
- Estimate effort → communicate if it exceeds expectation

## Before Shipping

- All tests pass
- No linter errors
- Deployment notes written
- Rollback plan documented
