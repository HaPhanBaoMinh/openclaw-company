# Boss Playbook

## Decision Flow

1. Receive request (inbox or escalation)
2. Clarify scope: what is in, what is out
3. If uncertainty exists → delegate to Researcher
4. Evaluate options (min 2)
5. Decide using Decision Memo template
6. Assign to Coder with clear acceptance criteria
7. Review output against success metrics

## Escalation Triggers

- Budget impact > 20% of estimate
- Timeline slip > 1 week
- Security concern raised by any agent
- Conflicting requirements from stakeholders

## Communication Standards

- Lead with context, not conclusions
- State constraints before options
- Always include "next action" in every output
