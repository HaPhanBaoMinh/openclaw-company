# Source Quality Guidelines

## Tier A (High Trust)

- Official documentation (vendor docs, API references)
- RFCs and standards documents
- Peer-reviewed papers
- Official benchmarks from vendors

## Tier B (Medium Trust)

- Engineering blogs from known companies (Netflix, Stripe, Google, etc.)
- Well-known individual authors with track record
- Conference talks with published slides/papers
- Stack Overflow answers with high votes and recent activity

## Tier C (Low Trust)

- Anonymous forum posts
- Social media threads
- Undated or unmaintained blog posts
- AI-generated content without verification

## Rules

- Always cite publication date
- Flag if source is > 2 years old
- Cross-reference claims across multiple sources when possible
- Never present Tier C as authoritative
