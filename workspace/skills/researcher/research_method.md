# Research Method

## Process

1. Receive question from Boss
2. Clarify constraints (time, budget, tech stack, compliance)
3. Search Tier A sources first
4. Build comparison matrix
5. Identify risks and trade-offs
6. State recommendation with confidence level
7. Deliver Research Brief

## Comparison Matrix Format

| Criteria | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Cost     |          |          |          |
| Maturity |          |          |          |
| Ecosystem|          |          |          |
| Risk     |          |          |          |
| Verdict  |          |          |          |

## Confidence Levels

- **High:** Multiple Tier A sources agree, proven in production
- **Medium:** Some evidence, limited production data
- **Low:** Sparse evidence, emerging technology, conflicting sources
